### Creating a Vite Project 
```
npm create vite@latest
```

### Config
By default, 
* Vite will assume package folder (where package.json lives in) as the root directory, so better leave index.html in that folder, rather than put it into `src` folder. 
* Vite will bundle assets from `public` folder, so leave images in that folder, don't put them in `src` folder.
